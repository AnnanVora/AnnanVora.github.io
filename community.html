                    <p class="description">
                        <li>Performed an extensive survery of 80 households in Dudhani village, Maharashtra, IN.</li>
                        <li>Conducted with the Centre for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas (CTARA) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB).</li>
                        <li>This was conducted to review and understand energy, food and water consumption trends as part of a larger programme to implement green-energy sources in the village.</li>
                        <li>I was amazed to realize the economic situation at the grassroots level in India, having lived only in urban settings. Families barely had continous access to electricity and still used wells with mechanical pumps. Also, they would have to walk long distances everyday to obtain firewood due to an absence of gas.</li>
                        <li>Now, we are working to develop solutions to install solar panels according to their consumption of energy. This will facilitate pumps for the wells, electricity for household usage and energy to use for cooking.</li>
