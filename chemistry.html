                        Observed the functioning of an industrial plant manufacturing aromatic compounds and camphor at the scale of 6 Mega tonnes per year. Drew insights on chemical engineering aspects on how chemical process in the lab need to be upscaled fro production and the challenges in doing so.

                        Mainly observed development of novel catalysts used for more efficient synthesis of dimethyl ether as a green fuel alternative to diesel. Viewed a small pilot plant for its proposed manufacturing process, using two reactors and a cyclic synthesis system design to generate zero waste and almost 100% efficieny. Additionally observed X-Ray diffraction facilities for crystallography studies on the development of inorganic catalysts.
