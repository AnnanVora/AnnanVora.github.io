                    <p class="description">One of the most rewarding experiences of the past three years was this cultural exchange program to Spain. For me, it was the first time staying with a family of a completely different structure, culture, and language. The cultural difference started right from the first instant when I had to greet my host's mother with the traditional European kisses. This was something I had never done before and was new exposure to cultural differences. Such novel experiences continued through as I tried new foods and was introduced to new customs. I feel that this exchange was an extremely eye-opening experience and one that made me more open-minded and introduced me to different perspectives.</p>

                    <p class="description">I hosted a Czech student for 2 weeks and was amazed to see how well he was able to adapt to the Indian culture, escpecially the food and family structure. He accompanied me to my grandparents' 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebration on his very first day in Mumbai and told me it was probably the biggest family celebration he had ever been to. This was an eye-opener for me, making me realize how unique each cultures is.</p>
